Mini ChatGPT - Local HTML Chatbot using OpenAI API (with Python Proxy)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Replace the placeholder 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in server.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   python3 server.py

3. In your browser, go to:
   http://localhost:8000/index.html

4. Chat away! The browser talks to the Python server, which talks to OpenAI.

Note: Do NOT share your OpenAI API key or upload this publicly.
